This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3511

This simple script create text object for left and right of a statement. e.g

stri|ng = "Hello World"


| is where your cursor is, in command mode
type ciL (change inner and L for the right hand sided)

the line will become

string = |

similarily

ciH, diH, yiH etc will change, delete, yank the left hand side of the statement

this also works for ==, => as well

Note if the line end with ',' or ';' it will be the boundary of the right hand side
If there is a space before the separator (=, ==, =>) or after, they are so the the boundary
