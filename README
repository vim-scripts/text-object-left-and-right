This simple script create text object for left and right of a statement. e.g

stri|ng = "Hello World"


| is where your cursor is, in command mode
type ciL (change inner and L for the right hand sided)

the line will become

string = |

similarily

ciH, diH, yiH etc will change, delete, yank the left hand side of the statement

this also works for ==, => as well
